<!--The svg element is the root element of the whole svg canvas which includes images and texts. It's attributes-->

<!--The rect element of svg is used in drawing a rectangle and the x-y attributes are meant to set the placement and breath of the rectangle whereas the ry-rx attributes are meant to set the corner of the rectangle into the curvy shape. 
Similarly the circle element is used to make a circle with the position being able to be altered or set by the cx-cy attributes-->

<!--Lastly the text element is used which draws the text and it's attributes are again used to do the correct placement of the text-->
